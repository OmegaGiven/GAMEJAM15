This is my second camp fire animation.  Second animation ever actually.  My first one was a quick attempt for the fire challenge.  It came out looking alright but I wasn't satisified with it.

I thought this one came out so good it deserved it's own submission instead of just slipping it into the old submission.

The camp fire is based on Jetrel's camp fire here in this tileset.  I pixeled every flame burst and the only thing that Jetrel drew is what doesn't move in the animation.

I was motivated to make this camp fire animation for Bertram's game VT.  He said he was going to look into using my first fire animation so I figured I'd try to make a better one for his game.  It's nice seeing my art being put to good use :D

Root's is going to put this to good use in his game HOA also :)

If you use this in a game, please let me know- I like to know that my work is useful and love checking out other project's.
